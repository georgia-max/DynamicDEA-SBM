## Overview

This repository contains Python code to replicate the Dynamics Stochastic Block Model (SBM) proposed in Tone's 2010 paper. The Dynamics SBM is a statistical model widely used for analyzing the evolving structure of dynamic networks. This project aims to provide an open-source implementation for researchers and practitioners interested in understanding and applying the Dynamics SBM.
